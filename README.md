Eighteenth week's homework for UNH Full-Stack Web Development Boot Camp

## Description

The goal of this project was to create a Mongo database and handle routes with Express - in conjunction with provided front-end code - to create a fitness tracker. Our main tasks were to ensure that:

* When the user loads the page, they are given the option to create a new workout or update their last workout. 

* The user should be able to add exercises to the most recent workout plan.

* The user should be able to add new exercises to a new workout plan.

* The user should be able to view the combined weight of multiple exercises from the past seven workouts on a 'stats' page.

* The user should be able to view the total duration of each workout from the past seven workouts on a 'stats' page.
